# hi, im pj0001
im a developer and (un)professional pentester mostly interested in exploits, and a dumb game called Garry's Mod,

there is nothing much on here public, hopefully thatll change but most of my current repositories contain private exploits and other stuff im not allowed to reveal.

you might know me from random stuff i do.
